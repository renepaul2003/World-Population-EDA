# World Population 2023- Exploratory Data Analysis
The goal is to gain insights, patterns, and trends in the data through visualizations and statistical analysis. The project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the world population data from the year 2023 using Python. Through visualizations and statistical analysis, the aim is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights within the dataset, providing a comprehensive understanding of global population dynamics during that specific year.

*  Two major sources that assess and publish global population are : the United Nations and the U.S. Census Bureau
* The United Nations Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs every two years calculates, updates, and publishes estimates of total population in its World Population Prospects series
* These population estimates and projections provide the standard and consistent set of population figures that are used throughout the United Nations system
